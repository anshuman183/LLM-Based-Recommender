This project implements a **Recommender System powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
The notebook demonstrates how natural language processing and embeddings can be leveraged to generate recommendations from unstructured data.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

- **Objective**: Build a recommender system that suggests items based on user queries and descriptions.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Generate embeddings for items/documents.  
  - Compute similarity between user queries and items using vector search.  
  - Use an **LLM layer** to refine or explain recommendations.  

- **Use Cases**:  
  - Job recommendation based on resumes & descriptions.  
  - Product recommendation based on reviews.  
  - Content recommendation (articles, books, media).
